### About the Project
Trime is an App that connects trainers and trainees and simplifies the complete process of personal training from finding, comparing, booking and having a complete training journal online. We had Trime as a client and our goal was to improve UX and UI interactions and the design of the app and do a prototype app to implement three features on their app: a sign up, a feed (general and personal) and a search menu.  

**Purpose**
1. Create a new version of Trime's app and upgrade the UX/UI interactions 
2. Operate as a cross-functional team using the Scrum Framework
3. A deliverable that adds value to the client's current app
4. Learn and develop skills on UX and Frontend Development
